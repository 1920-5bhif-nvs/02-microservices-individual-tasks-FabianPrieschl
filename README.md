# Second Quarkus Example - Multiple Microservices + Metrics and Health
The task was to create a second microservice project which connects to the first microservice.
**(First Quarkus Example - JPA)** Adding a metrics and health report to the project was also
part of the exercise. Last but not least I also created a small junit 5 test which tests the REST endpoint.

#### Prometheus
Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. It helps visualize metric data with the use of graphs.
It can also send out alerts when the system breaks or certain metric values are reached.

#### Istio

Istio is an open technology that provides a way for developers to seamlessly connect, 
manage and secure networks of different microservices â€” regardless of platform, source or vendor.
